# High Availability & Disaster Recovery

## Introduction

In today's digital economy, system downtime can have significant financial and reputational impacts on businesses. For TechModa, a fashion e-commerce platform operating globally, any disruption to their product catalog API or ordering system directly affects revenue and customer trust.

This series of labs focuses on implementing high availability and disaster recovery solutions for TechModa's serverless product API, ensuring that the business can maintain operations even in the face of infrastructure failures or disasters.

## Business Case: TechModa

TechModa has experienced several incidents that have highlighted the need for improved availability and disaster recovery capabilities:

1. **Fashion Week Traffic Surge**: During Paris Fashion Week, traffic to the platform increased by 800%, causing the API to become unresponsive and resulting in an estimated $200,000 in lost sales.

2. **Regional Service Disruption**: A regional AWS service disruption caused a 3-hour outage of the product catalog, affecting customers in Europe and resulting in negative social media coverage.

3. **Data Corruption Incident**: A deployment error led to partial data corruption in the product database, requiring 8 hours to restore from backups and reconcile recent transactions.

TechModa's CTO has mandated the implementation of a comprehensive high availability and disaster recovery strategy that can:

- Ensure 99.99% uptime for the product catalog API
- Support automatic scaling for up to 10x normal traffic
- Guarantee recovery point objective (RPO) of less than 15 minutes
- Achieve recovery time objective (RTO) of less than 30 minutes
- Implement proactive monitoring and alerting to detect potential issues before they impact customers

## Labs Overview

Through this series of labs, you will implement solutions to meet TechModa's requirements:

1. **[Setting up Multi-AZ Architecture](lab1.md)** - Distribute the serverless API across multiple Availability Zones to ensure continued operation even if an entire AZ fails.

2. **[Implementing Auto Scaling](lab2.md)** - Configure dynamic scaling of Lambda functions and DynamoDB capacity to handle variable traffic patterns.

3. **[Disaster Recovery Strategies](lab3.md)** - Implement cross-region replication and recovery procedures to protect against regional failures.

4. **[Monitoring with CloudWatch](lab4.md)** - Set up comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and automated incident response.

5. **[Proyecto Capstone: Solución Integral de Alta Disponibilidad](proyecto-capstone.md)** - Implementar una solución completa que integre todos los conceptos anteriores.
